# Setting up Pipelines Drift Detection

If you are a Pipelines Enterprise customer and used the infrastructure-live-root repository template to install Pipelines, Drift Detection is already included and available as a GitHub workflow in your repository.

For installations not based on the template, follow the [Installing Drift Detection Guide](/2.0/docs/pipelines/guides/installing-drift-detection.md) to enable Drift Detection.
