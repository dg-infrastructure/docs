# Setting up Pipelines Drift Detection

If you are a Pipelines Enterprise customer and used the infrastructure-live-root repository template to install Pipelines, Drift Detection is already included and available as a GitHub workflow in your repository.

If you installed Pipelines using a method other than the template and would like to add Drift Detection, refer to the [Installing Drift Detection Guide](/2.0/docs/pipelines/guides/installing-drift-detection.md).
