# Updating Your Pipeline

Keeping Gruntwork Pipelines updated is straightforward. Regular updates are released to ensure optimal performance and scalability for managing infrastructure changes.

Regular updates are released for the Pipelines CLI, associated GitHub Actions Workflows, and custom GitHub Actions. To apply the latest updates across these components, modify the `pipelines.yml` file located in the `.github/workflows` directory of any repository integrated with Gruntwork Pipelines. Update the file to reference the latest version of the Pipelines GitHub Actions Workflow:

```yml
jobs:
  GruntworkPipelines:
    uses: gruntwork-io-team/pipelines-workflows/.github/workflows/pipelines-root.yml@v3.0.0
```

Due to our integration with [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide), you can automatically receive pull requests suggesting updates to the `pipelines.yml` file in your repository by including a `.github/dependabot.yml` file. This ensures your repository stays aligned with the latest changes in Gruntwork Pipelines. DevOps Foundations customers receive this configuration as part of their `infrastructure-live` repositories by default.

:::note

Gruntwork recommends leaving your workflow reference at a major-tag shorthand, such as `v3` to automatically get the latest minor-tag updates.

### Updating customized workflows

If you have customized workflows as outlined in [Extending Pipelines](/2.0/docs/pipelines/guides/extending-pipelines.md), maintaining updates to these workflows may require additional effort. For those who have forked the [pipelines-workflows](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pipelines-workflows) repository to implement customizations, manual updates will be necessary to incorporate the latest changes from the upstream repository.

To update your workflows, follow the instructions provided in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork). This process applies as long as there are no conflicts between your customizations and the upstream repository.

Regular updates are released for the Pipelines CLI and GitLab CI/CD templates. To apply the latest updates, modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in any project integrated with Gruntwork Pipelines. Update the include statement to reference the latest version:

```yml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/gruntwork-io/pipelines-workflows/pipelines@v1.0.0
```

We recommend using GitLab's [Renovate integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/renovate.html) to automatically receive merge requests suggesting updates to your pipeline configuration. This ensures your project stays aligned with the latest changes in Gruntwork Pipelines.

Gruntwork recommends leaving your workflow reference at a major-tag shorthand, such as `v1` to automatically get the latest minor-tag updates.
