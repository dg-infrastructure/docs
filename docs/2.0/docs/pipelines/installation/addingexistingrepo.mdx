# Bootstrap Pipelines in an Existing Repository

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import PersistentCheckbox from '/src/components/PersistentCheckbox';

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for integrating [Gruntwork Pipelines](https://gruntwork.io/products/pipelines/) into an existing repository with Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This is designed for Gruntwork customers who want to add Pipelines to their current infrastructure repositories for streamlined CI/CD management.

To configure Gruntwork Pipelines in an existing repository, complete the following steps (which are explained in detail below):

1. **Plan your Pipelines setup** by identifying all environments and cloud accounts/subscriptions you need to manage.
2. **Bootstrap core infrastructure** in accounts/subscriptions that don't already have the required OIDC and state management resources.
3. **Configure SCM access** using either the [Gruntwork.io GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/gruntwork-io) or [machine users](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#user-accounts).
4. **Create `.gruntwork` HCL configurations** to tell Pipelines how to authenticate and organize your environments.
5. **Create `.github/workflows/pipelines.yml`** to configure your GitHub Actions workflow.
6. **Commit and push** your changes to activate Pipelines.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **An active Gruntwork subscription** with Pipelines access. Verify by checking the [Gruntwork Developer Portal](https://app.gruntwork.io/account) and confirming access to "pipelines" repositories in your GitHub team.
- **Cloud provider credentials** with permissions to create OIDC providers and IAM roles in accounts where Pipelines will manage infrastructure.
- **Git installed** locally for cloning and managing your repository.
- **Existing IaC repository** with Terragrunt configurations you want to manage with Pipelines (if you are using OpenTofu/Terraform, and want to start using Terragrunt, read the [Quickstart Guide](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start)).

## Planning Your Pipelines Setup

Before implementing Pipelines, it's crucial to plan your setup by identifying all the environments and cloud resources you need to manage.

### Identify Your Environments

Review your existing repository structure and identify:

1. **All environments** you want to manage with Pipelines (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`)
2. **Cloud accounts/subscriptions** associated with each environment
3. **Directory paths** in your repository that contain Terragrunt units for each environment
4. **Existing OIDC resources** that may already be provisioned in your accounts

### Determine Required OIDC Roles

For each AWS Account / Azure Subscription you want to manage, you might already have some or all of the following resources provisioned.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="aws" label="AWS" default>

**Required AWS Resources:**

- An OIDC provider for GitHub Actions
- An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt plan commands
- An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt apply commands

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="azure" label="Azure">

**Required Azure Resources:**

- Entra ID Application for plans with Federated Identity Credential
- Entra ID Application for applies with Federated Identity Credential
- Service Principals with appropriate role assignments
- Storage Account and Container for Terragrunt state storage (if not already existing)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<PersistentCheckbox id="identify-existing-resources" label="Identify which resources already exist and which need to be created." />

:::

## Configuring SCM Access

Pipelines needs the ability to interact with Source Control Management (SCM) platforms to fetch resources (e.g. IaC code, reusable CI/CD code and the Pipelines binary itself).

There are two ways to configure SCM access for Pipelines:

1. Using the [Gruntwork.io GitHub App](/2.0/docs/pipelines/installation/viagithubapp#configuration) (recommended for most GitHub users).
2. Using a [machine user](/2.0/docs/pipelines/installation/viamachineusers.md) (recommended for GitHub users who cannot use the GitHub App).

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="configure-scm-access" label="Configure SCM access for Pipelines using the documentation above." />

## Bootstrapping Core Infrastructure

If your cloud accounts/subscriptions don't already have all the required OIDC and state management resources, you'll need to bootstrap them. This section provides the infrastructure code needed to set up these resources.

:::tip

If you already have all the resources listed, you can skip this section.

If you have some of them provisioned, but not all, you can decide to either destroy the resources you already have provisioned and recreate them or import them into state. If you are not sure, please contact [Gruntwork support](/support).

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="aws" label="AWS" default>

### AWS Bootstrap Resources

The resources you need provisioned in AWS to start managing resources with Pipelines are:

1. An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider
2. An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt plan commands
3. An IAM role for Pipelines to assume when running Terragrunt apply commands

For every account you want Pipelines to manage infrastructure in.

:::tip Don't Panic!

This may seem like a lot to set up, but the content you need to add to your repository is minimal. The majority of the work will be pulled from a reusable catalog that you'll reference in your repository.

If you want to peruse the catalog that's used in the bootstrap process, you can take a look at the [terragrunt-scale-catalog](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog) repository.

:::

### Bootstrap Your Repository for AWS

First, confirm that you have a `root.hcl` file in the root of your repository that looks something like this:

```hcl title="root.hcl"
locals {
  account_hcl       = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl"))
  state_bucket_name = local.account_hcl.locals.state_bucket_name

  region_hcl = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))
  aws_region = local.region_hcl.locals.aws_region
}

remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  generate = {
    path      = "backend.tf"
    if_exists = "overwrite"
  }
  config = {
    bucket       = local.state_bucket_name
    region       = local.aws_region
    key          = "${path_relative_to_include()}/tofu.tfstate"
    encrypt      = true
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}

generate "provider" {
  path      = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents  = <<EOF
provider "aws" {
  region = "${local.aws_region}"
}
EOF
}
```

If you don't have a `root.hcl` file, you might need to customize the bootstrapping process, as the Terragrunt scale catalog expects a `root.hcl` file in the root of the repository. Please contact [Gruntwork support](/support) for assistance if you need help.

For each AWS account that needs bootstrapping, create the following structure in your repository:

```hcl title="<account-name>/_global/bootstrap/terragrunt.stack.hcl"
locals {
  # You may need to adjust this path based on your repository structure
  account_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl", "terragrunt.hcl"))
}

stack "bootstrap" {
  source = "github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-scale-catalog//stacks/aws/github/pipelines-bootstrap?ref=v1.0.0"
  path   = "bootstrap"

  values = {
    # Set the OIDC resource prefix you want to use for your account.
    # This is used to determine the names of the OIDC resources like the IAM roles that are created.
    # e.g. `pipelines-plan`, `pipelines-apply`, etc.
    oidc_resource_prefix = "pipelines"

    # Set the organization name you want AWS to trust for OIDC.
    github_org_name = "your-github-org"

    # Set the repository name you want AWS to trust for OIDC.
    github_repo_name = "your-repo-name"

    # Set the name of the S3 bucket you want to use for state storage (must be globally unique)
    state_bucket_name = "your-unique-state-bucket-name"
  }
}
```

## Creating `.gruntwork` HCL Configurations

Create [HCL configurations](/2.0/reference/pipelines/configurations-as-code/) in the `.gruntwork` directory in the root of your repository to tell Pipelines how you plan to organize your infrastructure, and how you plan to have Pipelines authenticate with your cloud provider(s).

### The `repository` block

The core configuration that you'll want to start with is the `repository` block. This block tells Pipelines which branch has the "live" infrastructure you want provisioned. When you merge IaC to this branch, Pipelines will be triggered to update your infrastructure accordingly.

```hcl title=".gruntwork/repository.hcl"
repository {
  deploy_branch_name = "main"
}
```

:::note Progress Checklist

<PersistentCheckbox id="create-repository-hcl" label="Create a new `.gruntwork/repository.hcl` file in the root of your repository with the contents above." />
<PersistentCheckbox id="edit-repository-deploy-branch-name" label="Edit the value of `deploy_branch_name` in `.gruntwork/repository.hcl` if necessary." />

:::

### The `environment` block

Next, you'll want to define the environments you want to manage with Pipelines using the [`environment` block](/2.0/reference/pipelines/configurations-as-code/api#environment-block).

For each environment, you'll want to define a [`filter` block](/2.0/reference/pipelines/configurations-as-code/api#filter-block) that tells Pipelines which units are part of that environment. You'll also want to define an [`authentication` block](/2.0/reference/pipelines/configurations-as-code/api#authentication-block) that tells Pipelines how to authenticate with your cloud provider(s) for that environment.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="aws" label="AWS" default>

```hcl title=".gruntwork/environment-production.hcl"
environment "production" {
  filter {
    paths = ["prod/*"]
  }

      plan_iam_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/pipelines-plan"
      apply_iam_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/pipelines-apply"
