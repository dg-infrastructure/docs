# Patcher Update

Starting in `0.4.1`, Patcher applies patches using a Docker sandbox by default and pulls the latest version of the [`gruntwork/patcher_bash_env`](https://hub.docker.com/r/gruntwork/patcher_bash_env) image.  

To run Patcher locally without Docker or in a CI pipeline, use the `--skip-container-runtime` flag.  

The `patcher update` command updates some or all module dependencies in the current folder and any child folders.  

Patcher supports two modes: **interactive mode** and **non-interactive mode**.  

## Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, the `patcher update` command allows you to selectively update dependencies one module at a time.  

Example usage:
```
patcher update prod
```

After scanning for dependencies, Patcher displays the 'Modules View'.  

- If all dependencies are up to date, Patcher displays a checkmark in the **"Up to date"** column.

- If Patcher detects updates, it offers two options:  
 
    * Press `ENTER` to update all usages to the **next safe version**.  
    * Press `b` to update all usages to the **next version**, including breaking changes.  

![Patcher update screenshot showing dependency that can be updated](/img/guides/stay-up-to-date/patcher/patcher-update-overview-update-available.png)  

- Pressing `ENTER` updates to the highest version **before** the next breaking change or to the latest version, whichever comes first.  
- Pressing `b` updates to the next breaking change or the latest version, whichever comes first.  

After updating, the **"Up to date"** column changes to **"Updated"**, indicating that at least one dependency has been updated.

When you exit Patcher, it writes the update details to `stdout` in YAML format:

### Navigation Commands  

1. While in the modules view, press `u` to display the usages. This shows all locations where the module is being used:

2. While in the modules view, press `v` to view the changelogs for a module. Press `o` to open the changelog page in your browser.

If a module, including third-party modules, does not have a `CHANGELOG.md` file, press `o` to open the repository's releases page.

## Non-Interactive Mode

:::caution  

Starting in `0.4.1`, Patcher applies patches using a Docker sandbox by default.  

To run Patcher in a CI pipeline, add the `--skip-container-runtime` flag.  

:::  

In non-interactive mode, Patcher updates all module dependencies in the current folder (and child folders) based on the specified update strategy.  

Non-interactive mode supports the `next-safe` and `next-breaking` update strategies.  

### Next Safe (Default)  

Using the [next safe update strategy](/2.0/docs/patcher/concepts/update-strategies/#next-safe-update-strategy-default), Patcher updates dependencies to the highest version **before** the next breaking change. If no breaking changes are found, it updates to the latest version of the module.  


Example usage:
```
patcher update --non-interactive --skip-container-runtime --update-strategy next-safe prod
```
Or just
```
patcher update --non-interactive --skip-container-runtime prod
```

### Next Breaking  

With the [next breaking update strategy](/2.0/docs/patcher/concepts/update-strategies#next-breaking-update-strategy), Patcher updates dependencies to the version containing the breaking change and then stops. If no breaking changes are encountered, it updates to the latest version of the module.  

If Patcher updates a dependency to a breaking version, it generates a `README-TO-COMPLETE-UPDATE.md` file in the folder containing the dependency. This file includes a release note extract for each dependency in that folder that was updated to a breaking change.  

Example usage:
```
patcher update --non-interactive --skip-container-runtime --update-strategy next-breaking prod
```

## Support for Third-Party Modules  

Patcher provides full support for third-party modules in both interactive and non-interactive modes, including your own custom modules.  

Starting in `0.4.3`, Patcher updates third-party modules based on semantic versioning (semver).  

For example, the [terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc) module has three recent versions: `5.0.0`, `5.1.0`, and `5.1.1`.  

In the `infrastructure-live/dev` environment, there is a dependency on `terraform-aws-vpc/vpc`:  
- `dev/us-east-1/prod/dev/terragrunt.hcl` currently uses version `4.0.0`.  

![Screenshot of third party module dependency with updates available](/img/guides/stay-up-to-date/patcher/patcher-update-overview-3p-update-available.png)  

Patcher updates this dependency to `5.0.0` because it is the next version containing a breaking change. It also generates a `README-TO-COMPLETE-UPDATE.md` file in the folder containing the dependency.

The `README-TO-COMPLETE-UPDATE.md` file includes the [release notes](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc/rele
```md
# vpc-endpoints v4.0.0 -> v5.0.0 (2023.08.15 13:39:56)

Updated dependency `vpc-endpoints` in `dev/us-east-1/dev/vpc/terragrunt.hcl` to version `v5.0.0`, which includes breaking changes. You MUST follow the instructions in the release notes to complete this update safely: https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc/releases/tag/v5.0.0  

Here are the release notes for version `v5.0.0`:
