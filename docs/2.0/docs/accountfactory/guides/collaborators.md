## Introduction

When creating new delegated repositories, you can configure a list of GitHub collaborators and their permissions to be added to the repository.

## Understanding collaborator settings

GitHub collaborators are defined in the [account-factory configuration](/2.0/reference/accountfactory/configurations#github-collaborators).

Each collaborator entry consists of a **Team Name** and a **Permission**.

#### Team name

Teams must exist within the GitHub organization where Account Factory is running.

To locate a Team Name, navigate to your GitHub organization and select the "Teams" tab. The Team Name is the unique identifier for each team.

In the example above, the Team Name is `platform-team`.

#### Permission

Permissions correspond to the <span class="external-link"><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/teams/teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28#add-or-update-team-repository-permissions">GitHub Teams API</a></span>. 

Available options include `pull`, `triage`, `push`, `maintain`, `admin`, or a custom repository role name if defined by your organization.

## Adding collaborators

To add a team to new delegated repositories, include a new entry in the `collaborators` block of your Account Factory configuration.

All collaborators specified for each account type will be added to the repositories of that type when they are created. If a team needs access to repositories of multiple types, you must add them in the configuration for each type.

A common practice is to create an administrative team with access to all repositories, along with separate teams for each delegated repository.

For example, consider an organization with an administrative team called `platform-admins` and two account types, `foo` and `bar`. For each account type, you might create development teams with push access to their respective repositories, such as `foo-devs` and `bar-devs`.

The Account Factory configuration would look like this:

```yml title="./.gruntwork/config.yml"

pipelines:
  account-vending:
    foo:
      collaborators:
        - team: platform-admins
          permission: admin
        - team: foo-devs
          permission: push
    bar:
      collaborators:
        - team: platform-admins
          permission: admin
        - team: bar-devs
          permission: push
```

## Updating existing repositories

To update existing repositories, you must manually modify the repository settings.
