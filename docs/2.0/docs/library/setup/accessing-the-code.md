# Accessing the Code  

Gruntwork provides access to all code included in your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) library subscription through GitHub. To access the IaC Library, first [create an account in the Developer Portal](/2.0/docs/overview/getting-started/create-account). fter setting up your account, [link your GitHub ID](/2.0/docs/overview/getting-started/link-github-id) to your Developer Portal account to gain access.  

## Accessing modules and services in the IaC Library  

Once you can access the Gruntwork IaC library, you can view the source code for all modules and services in [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/gruntwork-io/repositories). Refer to the [Library Reference](/library/reference) for a complete list of available modules and services.  

In GitHub, each IaC repository adheres to a naming convention: it begins with the prefix `terraform-aws-`, followed by a description of the modules it contains. For example, Amazon SNS, SQS, MSK, and Kinesis modules reside in the `terraform-aws-messaging` repository. 

Within each repository:  
- Modules are located in the `modules` directory.  
- Example usage and tests are provided in the `examples` and `tests` directories, respectively.  

## Accessing modules: SSH vs. HTTPS  

Gruntwork modules reference each other internally using SSH. For example:  
```hcl
source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks.git//modules/eks-cluster-control-plane?ref=v0.58.0"
```

(This is in contrast to using https, e.g. `source = "git::https://github.com/...`.)

### Why use SSH?  

Gruntwork modules rely on SSH due to its widespread compatibility and minimal configuration requirements, making it a reliable choice that works seamlessly across diverse systems.

### Can I use HTTPS?  

The modules in the IaC Library reference each other via SSH. While you can initially reference a module using HTTPS, it may still pull in dependencies over SSH. As a result, exclusive use of HTTPS is not supported.

### What if I can't use SSH?  

If you cannot use SSH—such as in cases where corporate network restrictions block outbound access to port 22—you won’t be able to access the GitHub-hosted version of the library. However, you can [self-host](/2.0/docs/library/guides/self-hosting) the library using [repo-copier](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/repo-copier) as an alternative.

A self-hosted version of the library within your corporate network can typically accommodate most enterprise network restrictions.
