# Invite Your Team

Team members with an admin role can manage team membership. The first admin will also be prompted to invite their team immediately after signing in for the first time.

## Inviting team members

Invite team members to give them access to the portal and all resources included in your Gruntwork subscription.

1. Navigate to the **[Team](https://app.gruntwork.io/team)** page of the Gruntwork Developer Portal.
2. Click the **Invite** button. A new row will appear below the table of team members.
3. Enter the email address of the person you wish to invite.
4. Select the appropriate role for the team member. All members can access Gruntwork resources. Admins can additionally manage account information and team membership. (If you assign the wrong role, you can change it even after the invite has been sent.)
5. Press `ENTER` or click the arrow at the right of the row.

This will send an invitation to the provided email address. To invite additional team members, repeat steps 3–5. If an error occurs, an error icon will appear at the right of the row, allowing you to edit the email and retry.

## Changing user roles

Admins can change the role of any team member at any time, including those who haven’t accepted their invitation. This allows you to correct any mistakes made during the invitation process.

1. Locate the team member in the table whose role you wish to change.
2. Click on their current role.
3. Select a new role.

The change will take effect immediately. Team members who have already accepted their invitation will receive an email notification about the role update.

## Removing team members

Remove team members to free up licenses when they no longer require access to Gruntwork resources. You can also revoke pending invitations using the same process. Once removed, the user will no longer be able to sign in to the Gruntwork Developer Portal or access resources such as the IaC Library or Kodekloud video training courses.

1. Locate the team member you wish to remove in the table.
2. Hover over the row and click the red remove button on the right.
3. Confirm the removal to revoke their access.

The change will take effect immediately. If the removed team member has already accepted their invitation, they will receive an email notifying them that their access has been revoked.

## Requesting additional licenses

The number of licenses available depends on your subscription level. You can view the total and remaining licenses at the top of the [Team](https://app.gruntwork.io/team) page. If you need to invite more team members than your current license limit allows, you can request additional licenses at a standard monthly rate. Contact sales@gruntwork.io to request more licenses.
