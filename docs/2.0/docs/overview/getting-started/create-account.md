## 2. Confirm your email address

If you choose to continue with email, you’ll be prompted to check your inbox. Gruntwork uses a passwordless email authentication flow for every login. Click the link in the email to complete the sign-in process.

If you encounter an error stating that the link has expired, it may be due to security software such as Microsoft SafeLink™ or Mimecast, which pre-processes links and invalidates them. Request a new sign-in link, then refer to the **Trouble Signing In** section at the bottom of the email. Copy and paste the displayed link text directly into your browser to sign in.

:::note

For security, sign-in links expire after 10 minutes. You can request a new sign-in link anytime by entering your email at [app.gruntwork.io](https://app.gruntwork.io).

## 3. Provide account details

If you are the admin for your organization, you’ll be prompted to confirm details such as your company address, phone number, and billing email. Provide the required information and click **Continue** to complete the sign-in process.
