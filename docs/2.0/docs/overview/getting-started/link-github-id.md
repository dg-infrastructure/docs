# Link Your GitHub account

Gruntwork provides all code included in your subscription through GitHub. To access the IaC Library on GitHub, you must link your GitHub ID to your Gruntwork Developer Portal account. Follow these steps to complete the process:

1. Sign in to the [Gruntwork Developer Portal](https://app.gruntwork.io).
2. Click the **Link my GitHub Account** button, either in the notice at the top of the home page or in your [Profile Settings](https://app.gruntwork.io/settings/profile).
3. Sign in to your GitHub account and click the **Authorize** button to confirm the connection.
4. After being redirected back to the Gruntwork Developer Portal, click the **Accept My Invite** button. This will return you to GitHub, where you can accept an invitation to join the Gruntwork organization. (You can disregard the corresponding email invitation from GitHub.)
5. Click **Join Gruntwork** to accept the invitation and gain access to the IaC Library.

Once your account is linked, the notice on the home page will disappear, and your GitHub ID will be recorded in your [Profile Settings](https://app.gruntwork.io/settings/profile). You will then have access to all private repositories included in your subscription. If you haven’t done so already, we strongly recommend [adding an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to your GitHub account. This is required to access the Gruntwork IaC library without entering a password in your OpenTofu/Terraform code.

[GitHub now requires](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13) users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA). If you haven’t already, we recommend [enabling 2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) for your account and any machine users. For more details on 2FA benefits and potential impacts, see our [Knowledge Base article](https://github.com/orgs/gruntwork-io/discussions/764).
