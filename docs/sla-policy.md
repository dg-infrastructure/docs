# Service Level Agreement (SLA) Policy

We are committed to providing reliable, high-quality services to our customers. This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines our availability commitments, incident response procedures, and the transparency measures we employ to keep you informed about the health of our services.

## Service Availability Targets

### Production API Services

- **Monthly Uptime Target**: 99.9% (allows for 43 minutes of downtime per month)
- **Measured Services**:
  - Primary API endpoints ([api.prod.app.gruntwork.io](https://api.prod.app.gruntwork.io))
  - Authentication services

### How We Calculate Uptime

- **Simple Math**: (Total minutes in month - Downtime minutes) รท Total minutes in month ร 100
- **What Counts as Downtime**: Service is completely down or failing for more than 5% of requests
- **What Doesn't Count**: Scheduled maintenance (we'll tell you 72 hours ahead of time)

## Customer Remedies

While we strive to meet our SLA targets, we recognize that outages impact your business. For paying customers:

### Service Credits

| Monthly Uptime | Service Credit |
|----------------|----------------|
| 99.0% - 99.5% | 2.5% |
| 95.0% - 99.0% | 5% |
| < 95.0% | 10% |

### Credit Request Process

1. Submit request within 30 days of incident
2. Include affected services and timeframe
3. Credits applied to next billing cycle
4. Maximum credit per month: 10% of monthly service fees

## Incident Classification & Response Times

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Resolution Time | Communication |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Severity 1 (Critical)** | Complete service outage or critical functionality unavailable affecting multiple customers | 30 minutes | 4 hours | Immediate notification via status page and email |
| **Severity 2 (High)** | Significant degradation of service or critical functionality unavailable for a subset of customers | 1 hour | 8 hours | Status page update within 2 hours |
| **Severity 3 (Medium)** | Minor service degradation or non-critical functionality unavailable | 4 hours | 24 hours | Status page update within 4 hours |
| **Severity 4 (Low)** | Cosmetic issues or minor bugs with workarounds available | 1 business day | Best effort | As needed |

## How We Catch Problems Fast

We've set up several systems to catch issues before you even notice them:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Our systems watch critical endpoints 24/7 and alert us the moment something goes wrong
- **Automated Testing**: We regularly test authentication and pipeline workflows to catch issues before they affect you
- **Error Tracking**: We use tools like Sentry to get instant notifications when errors occur
- **Support Monitoring**: Our team watches support channels during business hours to catch issues you report

## Communication & Transparency

   - Updated timeline if things change
3. **All Clear**
   - Everything is back to normal
   - Quick summary of what happened
   - We'll do a full review and share lessons learned

### After We Fix It

- **What Happened**: Step-by-step timeline of the incident
- **Who Was Affected**: How many customers and what services were impacted
