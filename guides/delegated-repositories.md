## Introduction

When using Account Factory to request new accounts, you can choose to delegate management of the new accounts. Delegating management creates a new GitHub repository for each account, allowing developer teams to manage their own infrastructure within their accounts.

Specific permissions for IaC changes are managed via IAM roles in your `infrastructure-live-access-control` repository, enabling your infrastructure team to act as a central authority for permissions.


### Step 1 - Update Account Factory settings

Account Factory options are defined in the `.gruntwork/config.yml` file. For a full description of all available options, refer to the [configuration reference](/2.0/reference/accountfactory/configurations).

The following options are especially relevant for delegated repositories and should be reviewed or updated before creating new accounts:

#### Catalog repositories

Catalog repositories are used by developer teams when running `terragrunt catalog` in their delegated repositories. By default, this points to your `infrastructure-catalog` repository, but you can customize the list. These values will be included in the newly created repositories.

[catalog-repositories](/2.0/reference/accountfactory/configurations#catalog-repositories)


#### GitHub collaborators

GitHub collaborators define the list of teams granted automatic access to the new repository. This is optional, but we recommend configuring teams and permissions to streamline the account vending process.

### Step 2 - Requesting the account

Open the `.github/workflows/account-factory-inputs.html` file in a web browser from your `infrastructure-live-root` repository. This page is used to generate the initial account request payload for the account factory workflow.

The account name field will be used as the suffix for the GitHub repository name.

In the above example, a new repository named `infra-live-new-account` will be created. Ensure the account name is unique to avoid conflicts with existing repositories in your GitHub organization.

Fill out the form and check the "Delegate Management of Account(s)?" option.

Click "Generate" and copy the resulting JSON payload. This payload will be passed to the Account Factory workflow.

### Step 3 - Run the Account Factory workflow

Go to the Actions tab in your `infrastructure-live-root` repository and select the Account Factory workflow from the left-hand pane.

Click "Run Workflow," paste the JSON payload into the input field, and execute the workflow.

### Step 4 - Merge the Request PR

The Account Factory workflow will generate a new Pull Request, adding a YAML file to the `_new-account-requests` directory.

Review the Pull Request to ensure everything looks correct, then merge it. Once merged into the main branch, Pipelines will automatically run a `terragrunt apply` to create the new account in AWS.

Provisioning typically takes around 10 minutes, but it may vary. Once complete, a new Pull Request will be created in the `infrastructure-live-root` repository to baseline the account.

### Step 5 - Merge the Baseline PR

The Baseline PR includes essential infrastructure for the delegated repository to manage infrastructure changes in AWS, along with account-specific infrastructure like VPCs if configured.

Inspect the Baseline PR and merge it into the main branch. This triggers:

- Terragrunt to apply core baselines (security, logs, shared) for the new account(s).
- Baseline application for the new account(s), creating any requested infrastructure.
- Pipelines to create the new repository for the account(s), including:
  - Configuring collaborators from your settings.
  - Enabling branch protection (may fail on free GitHub plans).
  - Creating a Pull Request in the new repository with base IaC and Pipelines workflows.
  - Creating a Pull Request in the `infrastructure-live-access-control` repository for IAM roles.

Upon completion, the workflow run will display a summary linking to the new Pull Requests.

Merge the Access Control PR before running workflows in the new repository.

<PersistentCheckbox id="vending-delegated-repositories-5" label="Account Baselined and Repository Created" />

### Step 6 - Merge the Access Control PR

Review the Access Control Pull Request, which adds two new roles: `delegated-pipelines-apply-role` and `delegated-pipelines-plan-role`. These roles grant the minimum permissions required to bootstrap the new repository.

To add additional permissions, modify the [iam_policy](/reference/modules/terraform-aws-security/github-actions-iam-role/#iam_policy) block in each role.

Managing these roles through the `infrastructure-live-access-control` repository ensures your platform team retains control over changes in the delegated repository.

Merge the PR and allow Pipelines to apply the Terragrunt changes, creating the roles in AWS.

<PersistentCheckbox id="vending-delegated-repositories-6" label="Access Control PR Merged and Roles Created" />

### Step 7 - Merge the delegated repository Bootstrap PR

Once the Access Control PR has been merged and applied, navigate to the delegated repository and review the Bootstrap PR.

This PR contains the necessary GitHub workflow files for Pipelines and Terragrunt configurations to deploy new infrastructure.

Merge the PR, and the delegated repository will be ready for use.

### Step 8 - Start adding new infrastructure

At this point, you will have:
- Provisioned a new AWS account(s).
- Applied baselines for the new account(s).
- Created a new repository for managing infrastructure changes in the account(s).
- Configured new IAM roles for permissions in the delegated repository.
- Bootstrapped the repository for adding infrastructure.

You can now begin adding new infrastructure to the delegated repository.
