Pipelines supports both GitHub and GitLab.  

GitLab does not yet support account factory.
GitLab does not yet support the same level of customization as GitHub
GitLab requires one machine user with just one token and does not have a gitlab app.  
GitLab does require an account in the gruntwork management portal, and the customer has to inform gruntwork as to what groups they are using in GitLab, and gruntwork will authorize those groups
