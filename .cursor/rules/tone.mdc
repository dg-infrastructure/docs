description: Setting the tone of documentation content
globs:

Our voice for documentation content is:

**Relatable / Down-to-Earth / Knowledgeable, but Not Arrogant**
* Write as if you’re talking to a peer, not a corporate overlord—approachable, clear, and free from jargon.
* Use a friendly, no-nonsense tone that feels natural and easy to understand.
* Explain complex concepts in a way that educates and empowers, not overwhelms.

**Writing Style Guidelines**
* Use plain, clear language. If a reader needs to Google a word, we’re doing it wrong.
* Write like a human, not a machine. No stiff, robotic corporate-speak—this should feel like a trusted friend explaining DevOps.
* Avoid buzzwords and clichés. We don’t "synergize mission-critical paradigms"—we simplify DevOps so teams can move faster.
* Use humor sparingly, but effectively. DevOps is hard—sometimes, a well-placed joke can make it feel a little easier.
